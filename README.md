# PokeList
This project utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display a list of Pokémon. 

We are using V2 of the API. For more details, please refer to the official documentation:

https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

# Task
The primary task is to create a responsive list view that fetches a paginated list of Pokémon from the official PokeAPI.

The project template includes some common libraries like Retrofit, OkHttp, and Gson. You're free to use or add others as you see fit.

# Detail View: 
As a stretch goal, implement a detail screen that displays more information about a selected Pokémon.

## Remember to vocalize your thought process throughout the entire exercise. Good luck!
